# NEXT JOB
## Group Proposal

Our application is a sleek, user-friendly web solution built on the NextJS framework. We've spiced up the design using MaterialUI for a modern look, and FontAwesome for engaging icons. The app features a home page, a FAQs section, and a contact-us page, all tailored to be responsive for a seamless experience on any device. Our workflow is powered by GitLab for smooth version control, and we've chosen Netlify for dependable hosting. This frontend-only application blends cutting-edge technologies to deliver robust functionality and an excellent user experience.

## Testing

We followed a step-by-step process to ensure the app's functionality and user experience. Here's how we did it:
* Manual Testing: Initially, We tested the developed functionality on our local environment. We carefully checked all the functions and addressed any problems we found.
* Merging and Deployment: Once we were confident in the app's functionality, we all merged our code in single branch and deployed it using Netlify, making it accessible in a live environment. While merging the code, we ran into a few problems. But we were able to fix it by reviewing all of the developed pages and their code. We also made sure that the code was properly formatted and that there were no errors.
* Second Round of Testing: After the deployment, we conducted another round of testing. This time, we focused on verifying that the whole app workes correctly in the live environment. While testing, we found a few bugs realted to responsiveness and fixed them. As per peer review, we also made some changes in the UI to make it more user friendly. We also made sure that the app was responsive and worked well on all devices.
* Thorough Testing: During testing, we considered various scenarios, including failure cases, responsiveness, and coverage of all app components. This helped us ensure that the app was robust and reliable.
* Final Deployment: After the second round of testing, we deployed the app again. This time, we were confident that the app was working properly and that it was ready for use.
* Final Testing: We conducted a final round of testing to ensure that the app was working properly.

## Deployment

The Netlify was used for hosting and deploying this web application. The following steps were part of the deployment process:

1. Link GitHub Account: The GitHub account was used to link the project repository to Netlify.
2. Choose and Configure Repository: In the Netlify dashboard, the specific repository containing the project code was chosen. Branch selection, environment variables, and other configuration options were configured as necessary.
3. Build and Deploy: Every time changes were pushed to the chosen branch in the GitHub repository, Netlify automatically started a build process. The build process involved compiling the NextJS and TypeScript code into optimized assets ready for deployment.
4. Live Deployment: After the build process had been successfully completed, the project was made available via a specific URL provided by Netlify and deployed on a live system.

By seamlessly integrating with GitHub and offering a user-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring, Netlify made the deployment process simpler.
