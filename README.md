## Testing

#### Process

The project was tested through manual testing, where the code was executed, and the output was observed to ensure its correctness and functionality. The testing process involved the following steps:

1. _Code Execution_: The code was executed in the appropriate environment.
2. _Observation of Output_: The output generated by the code was observed, including any logs or error messages.
3. _Error Handling_: If any errors or unexpected behavior were encountered, appropriate modifications were made to the code to resolve them.
4. _Validation of Functionality_: The output was compared against the expected results to verify the correctness of the code.

Although formal tests were not written, manual testing provided insights into the behavior and performance of the project. It allowed for quick feedback and iterative improvements during the development process.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Netlify, a popular platform for hosting and deploying web applications. The deployment process involved the following steps:

1. Connect GitHub Account: The project repository was connected to Netlify by linking the GitHub account associated with the project.
2. Select and Configure Repository: The specific repository containing the project code was selected in the Netlify dashboard. Configuration options such as build settings, environment variables, and branch selection were configured as required.
3. Build and Deploy: Netlify automatically triggered a build process whenever changes were pushed to the selected branch in the GitHub repository. The build process involved compiling the NextJS and TypeScript code into optimized assets ready for deployment.
4. Live Deployment: Once the build process was completed successfully, the project was deployed on a live system accessible via a unique URL provided by Netlify. The deployed project took advantage of Netlify's CDN (Content Delivery Network) for fast and efficient content delivery.

Netlify simplified the deployment process by seamlessly integrating with GitHub and providing an intuitive interface for configuration and monitoring
