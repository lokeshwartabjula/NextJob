### Deployemnt

The web project is deployed using Git and Netlify:

* The code is pushed to a Git repository, which serves as a version control system to track changes and manage collaboration.
* Netlify, a powerful hosting platform, is connected to the Git repository, allowing automatic deployments upon code changes or updates.
* Netlify's build process retrieves the latest code from the repository, runs necessary build scripts, and deploys the compiled project to a live web server for public access.

### Testing

The code was manually tested by a developer or tester:

* Inputs were provided, forms were submitted, and expected outputs were validated against desired results.
* Manual testing helped uncover issues, validate user experience, and ensure the web project functions as intended.
